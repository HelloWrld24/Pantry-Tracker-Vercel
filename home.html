            This Pantry Tracker is a project to show off my newly learned skills in front-end and a bit of back-end programming. 
            The project is connected with Firebase's Realtime Database, so any changes you make will be done in the database and reflected on the table that displays live data
            from the database. Feel free to add, remove, or delete items. Thanks for checking out my project!
        </p>

        <p class="h5">
            Hey, my name is Hou Wai. As of August 2024, I am an incoming freshman studying computer science. Having been introduced to coding in fifth grade by manipulating 
            command blocks on Scratch, I discovered my love for coding. Since then, I have been on a continuous journey, exploring the endless possibilities of coding. 
            As part of the Headstarter fellowship, I created this Pantry Tracker to show off my newly learned skills!
        </p>

            Key takeaways from this project üìå
        </p>

        <p class="h5">
            At the start of this project, I had no previous knowledge of front-end programming (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap) or back-end (JavaScript and Firebase). 
            I watched a couple of tutorials before I got bored and decided to learn by doing. The project was supposed to be due by the end of the week, but since I was learning 
            all the languages and concepts, it took me over three weeks to finish. Starting from creating non-functional black and white buttons to completing this project, 
            I am proud of how much I've learned and can't wait to continue building more projects and challenging myself!
